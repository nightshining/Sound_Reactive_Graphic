Sound_Reactive_Graphic
======================

A example program that attaches openFrameworks graphics to an Ableton Live session. I've included an xcode project and an ableton session in this repository. To use with Ableton you need to create a new session, create a virtual midi port (https://www.ableton.com/en/articles/using-virtual-MIDI-buses-live/), set midi channel to '1', click to set midi (parameters are highlighted blue). Now when you assign a parameter and then drag the ball it will assign to the corresponding parameter.
